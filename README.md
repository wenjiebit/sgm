# Semi-Global Matching on the GPU

This is the implementation of [Embedded real-time stereo estimation via Semi-Global Matching on the GPU](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050916306561), [D. Hernandez-Juarez](http://www.cvc.uab.es/people/dhernandez/) et al, ICCS 2016.

## How to compile and test

Simply use CMake and target the output directory as "build". In command line this would be (from the project root folder):

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## How to use it

Type: `./sgm dir p1 p2`

The arguments `p1` and `p2` are semi-global matching parameters, for more information read the SGM paper.
p1 is set to be 7 and p2 is set to be 100, for large scale sgm for only cpu, so you can try it. But if it works badly, you can change other values to get a try.

`dir` is the name of the directory which needs this format:

```
dir
---- left (images taken from the left camera)
---- right (right camera)
---- disparities (results will be here)
```

## Limitations

- Maximum disparity has to be 128
- Image width and height must be a divisible by 4
